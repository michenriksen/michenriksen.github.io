[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl] is a great game but, IMO, it needs some tweaks for a better experience. These
are the mods I play with:

- [Grok's Modular Mutants Health]: Mutants are ridiculously tanky. This mod reduces their health pool to something more
reasonable.
- [Maklane's Better gunfights]: Adjusts NPC bullet dispersion for medium and long distances, making their aim less
precise at range while keeping close-range accuracy unchanged for more balanced and fun firefights.
- [Axxii's Stealth Mod]: I like a sneaky/tactical play style, and this mod tweaks the game's mechanics to be more
playable in this fashion.
- [Realistic Damage]: A human should not survive 3+ assault rifle rounds to the chest. The _Realistic EXtreme_ variant
of this mod makes damage to humans more realistic. And it goes both ways, so NPCs will also have an easier time killing
you, which is only fair.
- [Equalized Aim Sensitivity X-Y]: Adjusts mouse sensitivity to ensure equal scaling for both X (horizontal) and Y
(vertical) axes.
- [Empty Hands Zoom]: Increases empty hand zoom by +50%, +100%, or +150% to work as a primitive substitute for the
[binoculars] in the previous games.
