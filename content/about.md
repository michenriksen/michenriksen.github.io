I'm Michael, currently based in Copenhagen, Denmark. Professionally, I work as a Vulnerability Research Engineer at
GitLab.

Outside of work, I like to code on open source projects and learn new things. This website is a place for me to share
my thoughts, projects, learnings, and other things I find interesting.

You can also find me on [Mastodon] where I post more frequent, bite-sized updates and thoughts.
