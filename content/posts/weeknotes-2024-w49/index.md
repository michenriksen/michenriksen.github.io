- My gaming computer has arrived, and I'm now exploring The Zone in [S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl]. The game is
running super smooth on maximum graphics settings and the computer is surprisingly quiet. Here are my thoughts on the
game so far:
  - The game is super pretty and the atmosphere feels true to the STALKER series.
  - I miss the binoculars. Apparently, the reason they are not included in this game is because of the {{< sidenote "A-Life 2.0 system" >}}The underlying system of simulations that governs the behaviors and interactions of NPCs and monsters in the game.{{< /sidenote >}}
    which basically only spawns activity in a relatively small bubble around the player, so giving the player the
    ability to look far ahead would break the illusion of a map with life and activity everywhere. This is very
    unfortunate as The Zone in the old STALKER games felt much more alive when you could scout a military patrol
    getting into a random firefight with a group of bandits far away from your position.
  - I hate low-level, weak foes that don't really add anything to games other than being annoyances and a waste of ammo.
    In this game, it's the blind dogs, rodents, and boars.
  - The vanilla game needs some balancing for better gameplay IMO, so I play with a few mods that I have {{< backlink "stalker-2-mods" "documented here" >}}
    if you're interested.
  - The game definitely has its creepy moments, but so far, I don't feel as scared yet as I did in some missions in the
    previous games, like retrieving the documents from [Lab X-18]. Oh dear...
  - I'm terrible at remembering which ammo types work for the weapons I carry. It would be nice if the UI displayed some
    kind of indicator for ammo that is compatible with your primary, secondary, or sidearm.
  - {{< spoiler "Favorite moment so far (spoiler)" >}}Sneaking into the Commissary through the pipes and taking out
    _Roosevelt_ with a single \*pew\* from a suppressed pistol and sneaking back out without alerting anyone. The Zone
    likes it quiet!{{< /spoiler >}}
  - {{< spoiler "Worst moment so far (spoiler)" >}}The swamps at the old Clear Sky camp. This is the dumbest area
    and most frustrating mission in the game so far. Disabling the beacons while dealing with [Controllers](https://www.thegamer.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-every-mutant-fight-guide/#controllers)
    and [Psy Dogs](https://www.thegamer.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-every-mutant-fight-guide/#psy-dogs) is one
    thing, but the scripted events afterwards is just dumb and not enjoyable at all. I managed to run to a shack where
    I spent all my ammo killing the [Chimera](https://www.thegamer.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-every-mutant-fight-guide/#chimera)
    and hitting F5 to auto-save. I was stuck dying over and over in the scripted [emission](https://support.stalker2.com/hc/en-us/articles/27929344430353-Emission)
    that happens a few seconds later, as I'm not close enough to run to the mission marker and to shelter. I ended up
    using the _UETools_ developer console to get myself out of there. A lot of other players seem to be stuck in the same
    frustrating situation. I think the game developers should consider removing the emission event in a patch.{{< /spoiler >}}
  - {{< spoiler "Very unfortunate bug (spoiler)" >}}Even with the latest 1.0.3 patch, I ran into a known and pretty
    frustrating bug where events don't trigger properly when you want to defend Zalissya in the _On the Edge_ side
    mission.{{< /spoiler >}}
- With all the news about Russia's asymmetric warfare in the form of sabotage against critical infrastructure and cyber
attacks, I wonder how much asymmetric cyber-cyber pew-pew retaliation we might be doing that we just don't hear about?
I worry it could trigger {{< sidenote "Article 5" >}}NATO’s "an attack on one member is an attack on all" policy.{{< /sidenote >}}
one day, if it keeps happening, though...
- My best friend from school and my teenage years, who I lost touch with because, well, life happened, suddenly reached
out to me. It was such a great surprise, and I’m super excited to hang out again. I really miss the good old days of
making {{< sidenote "Deus Ex" >}}A 2000 cyberpunk-themed action role-playing game developed by Ion Storm and published by Eidos Interactive. Still one of the best games ever made IMO.{{< /sidenote >}}
mods, skateboarding, and watching [CKY movies].
