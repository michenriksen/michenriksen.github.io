- More work has been done on the [data inspection web tool][inspectra] I mentioned in the {{< backlink "weeknotes-2024-w45" "previous weeknotes" >}}.
It can now handle [MessagePack] encoding, Gzip and Zlib compression, and each analysis step now have tabs to view the
result as a hexdump and to view the frequency distribution in a chart.
- I use [Neovim] as my main editor, and generally feel comfortable in a keyboard-only environment, but whenever I
encounter merge conflicts in projects, I always open VS Code to resolve them. It's like resolving merge conflicts makes
me uneasy enough to feel I need the safety and comfort of pointing and clicking. I wonder if others recognize this kind
of behavior?
- In a documentary about the {{< sidenote "JuicyFields" >}}A global medicinal cannabis investment Ponzi scheme that
collapsed in 2022, taking everyone's money with it.{{< /sidenote >}} investment scam, I came across a new phrase:
"[Potemkin Village]," which describes a deceptive facade or superficial display created to give the illusion of success
or prosperity, intended to mislead observers and disguise reality.
- This is one of the nastiest {{< sidenote "dark patterns" >}}A user interface that has been carefully crafted to trick
users into doing things they didn't mean to.{{< /sidenote >}} I've encountered in the wild, and I wish the person who
came up with this idea a very Fuck You.
{{< figure src="dark-pattern.png" alt="Screenshot of a checkbox on a website with the label 'We’ll send you emails, SMS or push messages to tell you about great [REDACTED] deals and services. If you'd rather we didn’t, check the box.'" >}}
- I try to minimize my use of them, but damn, LLMs are really useful sometimes. I had a need for a tool to easily
"scramble" certain parts of a bunch of strings without losing their general format and structure. This prompt made
GPT-4o generate a web app that I could run on [JSFiddle] with a few {{< sidenote "follow-up prompts" >}}The first
version replaced numbers in selected hex sequences with an `a-f` letter, which was not what I wanted.{{< /sidenote >}}:

  ```markdown

  I need a simple web application that lets me enter a value into a text field and afterwards select parts with the
  cursor that I want to have replaced with random values

  ## Requirements

  - Uppercase letter should be replaced with an uppercase letter
  - Lowercase letter should be replaced with a lowercase letter
  - Number should be replaced with a number
  - Special characters like _ and - should be ignored
  - If the selected part matches a hex encoded sequence, the letter replacements should be restricted to a - f
  ```
- **If you have recently updated to macOS Sequoia and Spotlight no longer suggests applications:**
you need to open an app from the Dock or from Finder once before it shows up in Spotlight.

  > The trend of shallow user numbers and 'engagement' metrics taking centre stage in business valuations has created
    perverse incentives at a massive scale for software to indulge in unethical practices of 'engaging' users at any
    cost, with no respect for the limited and fast eroding levels of cognitive resources.
