- Been feeling the classic not-really-ill-not-really-well funk this week, so this is a shorter update.
- [@dpom@fosstodon.org] wrote a post on how to get color and undercurl support in Neovim when running in tmux and
  Alacritty. This is something I have {{< backlink "italic-text-in-alacritty-tmux-neovim" "written about before" >}},
  however, this solution is a bit cleaner. I've {{< backlink "alacritty-tmux-neovim-colors-and-undercurl" "created a note" >}}
  for easier copy/pasting and future reference.
- I've been watching a few Let's Play videos on the recently released {{< sidenote "S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl" >}}First-person shooter survival horror video game developed and published by GSC Game World.{{< /sidenote >}}
  game. I'm a big fan of, and used to play, the previous STALKER games, and this one inspired me to pull the trigger on
  a beefy gaming computer so I can play it myself. I can't wait to explore The Zone!
