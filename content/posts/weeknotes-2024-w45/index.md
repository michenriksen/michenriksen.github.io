I thought I would try out this weeknotes format which seems to have gained some popularity. I want to write more about
stuff that isn't technical in nature, and I think these weeknotes could be the way for me to do that. I don't know if
I'll be able to publish one every week, but I'll try my best!

If I can stick to the habit, I might look into making weeknotes a dedicated concept in my [Today I Learned](https://github.com/michenriksen/hugo-theme-til) theme.

- It's no surprise that the big one this week was the US presidential election. It wasn't fun going to bed while the
votes were being counted and waking up to see the results. I'm mighty disappointed he won his second term and I'm not
looking forward to see what him and his administration will manage to fuck up over the next years.
- I sort of rediscovered the concept of cold showers the other day when I forgot that the hot water was turned off for
maintenance. I don't really believe in all the claims about how it can cure depression and give you super powers, but
it's definitely refreshing and I love the endorphin kick and the sensation on your skin when you get out. A fun little
daily challenge to practice calming yourself down in a "stressful" situation.
- [regex101](https://regex101.com/) is my favorite tool for playing around with regular expressions, and I wanted to
find a way to link to it with pre-filled patterns and test strings as part of a thing at work. With a bit of guesswork
and the browser console, I managed to find the right URL parameters to do this.
I wrote a quick note about it if you're interested: {{< backlink "regex101-urls-with-pre-filled-values" >}}.
- Randomly stumbled on {{< sidenote "The Silence of the Lambs" >}}Thriller from 1991 directed by Jonathan Demme,
starring Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102926/">IMDB</a>).{{< /sidenote >}}
while looking for something to watch. Definitely one of the best movies ever made in my opinion; I think I could always
watch it. There's something soothing about early 90s movies as well.
- I signed up for an account on Twilio to get a secondary phone number for stuff. After going through all the setup and
paying them for the service, I was annoyed to discover that they redact text messages that look like
{{< sidenote "OTP" >}}One-Time Password or One-Time PIN used as a secondary authentication factor.{{< /sidenote >}} or
number verification messages, which is my primary use case. Of course, they don't seem to mention that little detail.
Anyway, their "anti-abuse" implementation sucks and I was able to get my code by changing the language settings to get a
message in Danish, which went through just fine.
- This weekend I've been working on a little web tool for inspecting data. It's kind of like a lightweight version of
[CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) but instead of building recipes, this tool automatically finds out what
to do with the data until it can't perform any further unpacking or decoding. It's still very much
{{< sidenote "WIP" >}}Work In Progress.{{< /sidenote >}}, but I have deployed an [alpha version here](https://michenriksen.com/inspectra/)
if you're interested. I will be adding many more analyzers for decompression and other interesting stuff over the next
days.
