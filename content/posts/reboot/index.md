Ah yes, it was time again to reboot my blog. If I don't write any posts, I might as well spend my time tinkering with
the blog itself, right?

My old blog was built with Jekyll, but since my world is all about Go now, I decided to use Hugo this time.

I started out thinking *"this time, I'll {{< sidenote "keep it simple" >}}Narrator:
he didn't keep it simple...{{< /sidenote >}} and focus on actual writing"* so naturally, I had to build my own theme
before I could start writing.

At least I think the theme came out pretty decent. I created the theme with a particular focus on legibility and
accessibility, as I think those are important aspects of a good website. I'm in no way a designer or expert in
accessibility, but I did my best and I welcome any feedback.

I plan to release the theme as open source when I have cleaned it up a bit and fixed some of the rough edges. While
building the theme, I also started working on an interesting little Go project that makes it easy to write automated
tests for a Hugo theme or website. I'll announce when it's all ready for release here, so stay tuned.
